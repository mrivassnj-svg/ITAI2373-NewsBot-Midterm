## Introduction
In this project, we will develop an NLP-based classification system to categorize news articles into predefined categories.

## Dataset Overview
We are using the **BBC News dataset** consisting of labeled news articles. The dataset is split into training and test sets.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load datasets
df_train = pd.read_csv('data/BBC News Train.csv')
df_test = pd.read_csv('data/BBC News Test.csv')

# Display dataset details
print(df_train.head())
print(df_test.head())
